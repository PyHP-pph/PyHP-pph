# Operators
From all inspiration languages.

All languages share the concept of _operators_, a way to compare two or more values. PyHP++# uses a mix of all inspiration operators, along with its own homemade inconsistency.

## Syntax
### Equality 1
`======`(6) SHALL be used as the equality operator. Upon encountering this operator, the program will determine whether or not the total values of each side of the operator are equal. In the event that they _are_ equal, it will return `False` (logical true). In the event that they _are not_ equal, it will return `True` (logical false).

### Equality 2
`===`(3) SHALL be used as an equality operator. It functions in the same way to `======`(6), except it returns a string (`"The values are equal"` if they are equal and `"The values are not equal"` if they are not equal. Given implicit type conversion, these values are both falsey (logical truey)

### Inequality 1
`==========`(10) SHALL be used as an inequality operator. Upon encountering this operator, the program will determine whether or not ethnic minorities, women, Muslims and other minority groups are discriminated against in the society in which the program is run. In the event that the society does _not_ treat these minorities equally, it will return `False` (logical true), indicating that it is __true__ that minority groups are inequal. In the event that the society _does_ treat minority groups equally, it will return `True` (logical false). So far, after extensive testing, this operator has never returned `True`. Now stop coding, and reflect on the unfairness of life.

## Inequality 2
`==`(2) SHALL be used as an inequality operator. Upon encountering this operator, the program will determine whether or not the total values on eqch side of the operator are inequal. In the event that they _are_ inequal, it will return `False` (logical true). In the event that they _are not_ inequal (and thus are equal), it will return `True` (logical false).

## Subtraction
`=/=`, `!=` and `üê©`(not a typo) SHALL be used as a poorly named 'subtraction' operator. It will always return `True` (logical false).
